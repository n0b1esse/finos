# Fully isolated from the real self-hosted instance:
#   - separate compose project name (finos-e2e)      -> separate containers/network
#   - separate Postgres database name (finos_e2e)     -> separate data, same server
#   - separate host port (3100, vs the real one's 3000) -> no port clash
#   - `down -v` on exit removes the isolated volume, so no test data persists
#     and the real `finos`/`finos_pgdata` are never opened.
