# Backend tests

Real integration tests against a real Postgres database — a dedicated
`finos_test` database created fresh, migrated, and dropped again on every
run. They never touch the real `finos` database or its data: the app's
`lifespan` startup (which seeds against the real DB) is never triggered, and
every route's DB dependency is overridden to point at `finos_test` instead.

## Running

The stack must already be up (`docker compose up -d`). Test dependencies
aren't baked into the production image, so install them once per container
lifetime, then run pytest inside the running `backend` container — it's the
only place with network access to Postgres:

```bash
docker compose exec backend pip install --user -r requirements-dev.txt
docker compose exec backend python -m pytest -v
```

Re-run just the `python -m pytest -v` line for subsequent runs; the
`pip install` only needs repeating after a container restart/rebuild.

Two details that both come from the container running as an unprivileged user
(`finos`, uid 10001 — see backend/Dockerfile) rather than root:

- `--user` on the install: site-packages belongs to root and isn't writable.
  The packages land in `/home/finos/.local`, which isn't on `PATH`, hence
  `python -m pytest` instead of a bare `pytest`.
- pytest prints a `PytestCacheWarning` about not being able to write
  `/app/.pytest_cache`. Expected — the source tree is read-only to the app
  user by design. Tests still pass; add `-p no:cacheprovider` to silence it.

## Adding a test

- Use the `client` fixture (an `httpx.AsyncClient` wired to the app) to hit
  the API the same way the frontend does — prefer this over reaching into
  services/models directly, so tests keep verifying the actual contract.
- `account_id` and `categories` fixtures give you the same default
  account/categories a real fresh install seeds.
- Every table is truncated and reseeded before each test (see
  `conftest.py::_clean_database`), so tests don't need to worry about
  leftover state or guess at IDs from a previous test.
