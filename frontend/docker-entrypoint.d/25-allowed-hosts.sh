# rebinding: a page on the open internet can point its own hostname at
# 127.0.0.1, wait for the DNS TTL to expire, and then have the victim's own
# browser issue same-origin requests to whatever is listening there. The
# browser's origin checks don't help — as far as it's concerned the request
# really is same-origin — but the Host header still carries the attacker's
# domain, so refusing hostnames we don't expect closes it.
#
# FINOS_ALLOWED_HOSTS is a space- or comma-separated list. Default covers
# local access only; add your own hostname when you serve FinOS under one
# (see .env.example). "*" disables the check entirely.
